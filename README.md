##  Overview

A modern recruitment tool that combines Go and Python for intelligent resume processing and candidate matching. The system uses Go for API and data management with sqlc for type-safe PostgreSQL operations and fuego for Firebase integration. The intelligence layer is powered by LlamaIndex in Python, enabling advanced resume parsing and matching capabilities.

##  Features

|      | Feature         | Summary       |
| :--- | :-------------- | :------------ |
| ⚙️   | **Architecture**  | The project follows a modular architecture, with each module responsible for a specific functionality. This makes the system easier to understand, maintain, and scale. It uses Go modules for dependency management. |
| 🔩   | **Code Quality**  | Code is well-structured and adheres to best practices such as clear naming conventions, proper error handling, and unit tests are written for all functions. The codebase also follows the Go standard library recommendations. |
| 📄   | **Documentation** | Documentation is primarily in English and includes comments throughout the codebase explaining complex logic or decisions. It uses a combination of SQL, YAML, JSON files to document database schema, API endpoints, and other configurations. The documentation is written using Go's built-in documentation tool `go doc`. |
| 🔌   | **Integrations**  | The project integrates with various services like PostgreSQL, UUID generation, HTTP requests, etc., through libraries such as 'pgservicefile', 'uuid', 'net/http'. It also uses external APIs via OpenAPI specifications in JSON format. |
| 🧩   | **Modularity**    | The codebase is divided into several packages that are independent and can be developed, tested, and deployed separately. This makes the system more maintainable and scalable. |
| ⚡️   | **Performance**   | The project is designed with performance in mind, making efficient use of resources and avoiding unnecessary computations. It uses goroutines for concurrent processing where possible. |
| 🛡️   | **Security**      | Security measures are implemented using Go's built-in crypto package for secure communication and data storage. Authentication is done through JWT tokens, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system. |
| 📦   | **Dependencies**  | The project has a lot of dependencies on external libraries like 'go modules', 'pgservicefile', etc., which are managed using Go's built-in package manager `go mod`. These dependencies ensure the smooth running of the application and its performance. |
| 🚀   | **Scalability**   | The architecture is designed to be scalable, with components like PostgreSQL being stateless allowing for easy scaling up or down based on demand. It also uses goroutines for concurrent processing which can handle high loads effectively. |
